# What problems does Hadoop Solve?

Big Data is one of the major areas of focus in todayâ€™s digital world. There are tons of data generated and collected from the various processes carried out by the company. This data could contain patterns and methods as to how the company can improve its processes. The data also contains feedback from the customer. Needless to say, this data is vital to the company and should not be discarded. But, the entire set is also not useful, a certain amount of data is futile. This set should be differentiated from the useful part and discarded. To carry out this major process, various platforms are used. The most popular among these platforms is Hadoop. Hadoop can efficiently analyse the data and extract the useful information. It also comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages such as:

### Pros
1. Range of data sources:
The data collected from various sources will be of structured or unstructured form. The sources can be social media, clickstream data or even email conversations. A lot of time would need to be allotted in order to convert all the collected data into a single format. Hadoop saves this time as it can derive valuable data from any form of data. It also has a variety of functions such as data warehousing, fraud detection, market campaign analysis etc.

2. Cost effective:
In conventional methods, companies had to spend a considerable amount of their benefits into storing large amounts of data. In certain cases they even had to delete large sets of raw data in order to make space for new data. There was a possibility of losing valuable information in such cases. By using Hadoop, this problem was completely solved. It is a cost-effective solution for data storage purposes. This helps in the long run because it stores the entire raw data generated by a company. If the company changes the direction of its processes in the future, it can easily refer to the raw data and take the necessary steps. This would not have been possible in the traditional approach because the raw data would have been deleted due to increase in expenses.

3. Speed:
Every organization uses a platform to get the work done at a faster rate. Hadoop enables the company to do just that with its data storage needs. It uses a storage system wherein the data is stored on a distributed file system. Since the tools used for the processing of data are located on same servers as the data, the processing operation is also carried out at a faster rate. Therefore, you can processes terabytes of data within minutes using Hadoop.

4. Multiple copies:
Hadoop automatically duplicates the data that is stored in it and creates multiple copies. This is done to ensure that in case there is a failure, data is not lost. Hadoop understands that the data stored by the company is important and should not be lost unless the company discards it.

# What are the key differences between Hadoop and Spark?
Hadoop is a software framework which is used to store and process Big Data. It breaks down large datasets into smaller pieces and processes them parallelly which saves time. It is a disk-based storage and processing system. It can scale from a single server to thousands of machines which increase its storage capacity and makes computation of data faster. For eg: A single machine might not be able to handle 100 gb of data. But if we split this data into 10 gb partitions, then 10 machines can parallelly process them.
In Hadoop, multiple machines connected to each other work collectively as a single system.

Spark is a software framework for processing Big Data. It uses in-memory processing for processing Big Data which makes it highly faster. It is also a distributed data processing engine. It does not have its own storage system like Hadoop has, so it requires a storage platform like HDFS. It can be run on local mode (Windows or UNIX based system) or cluster mode. It supports programming languages like Java, Scala, Python, and R.
