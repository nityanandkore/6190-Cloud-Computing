# What problems does Google App Engine solve?

There are two huge pros:
1. If you design your system to fit GAE’s model, Google will manage most of your operations for you. Scaling up/down, fault-tolerance, zero-downtime releases, traffic splitting for A/B testing or beta service releases, and host server management are all handled for you. That’s a lot of stuff, and a big claim. I have spent the last 5 years managing teams and consulting with clients to build out similar functionality on traditional VM based infrastructure; the amount of effort, time, and money that it will save you upfront is hard to articulate. You don’t get all of that for free though. You must design your application to match GAE’s expectations.
That is not the biggest advantage though. 

2. The biggest advantage is that you can stop talking about infrastructure and focus instead on your application and your business logic. That is probably what your customers are paying you for anyways. That means a more effective use of your engineering dollars. You’ll still need ongoing investment to make sure your developer and deployment workflow is streamlined, but that’s a much smaller surface area. This is a huge win — one that is hard to appreciate until you experience it.

# What problems does the Cloud Shell environment solve?

Cloud shell helps tremendously at management. Users can easily manage their own projects and resources without having to install the Google Cloud SDK on their local machine. Cloud Shell provides users with a command-line access directly from the browser.
Furthermore, client's necessary tools are pre-installed and always up to date. For instance, MySql client, Kubernetes, and Docker are configured and ready for users to access and use efficiently . Overall, clients save time not having to frequently re-install the latest version of these tools and all their respective dependencies.
