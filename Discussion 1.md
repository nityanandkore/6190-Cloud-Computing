# • What are the problems solved economically by cloud computing vs traditional infrastructure?
Since last decade cloud computing gaining more attention in the technology world. There are many advantages of cloud computing for the large as well as small scale enterprise organizations.
1. Lower Costs – Since cloud computing pools all of the computing resources that can be distributed to applications as needed, thus optimizing the use of the sum of the computing resources, it delivers better efficiency and utilization of the entire shared infrastructure. This also leads to lower costs for power and facilities due to the smaller footprint.
2. CapEx Free Computing – A public cloud delivers a better cash flow by eliminating the capital expense associated with building and updating the server infrastructure. 
3. Deploy Projects Faster, Foster Innovation – Because servers can be brought up & repurposed in a matter of minutes, the time to deploy a new application drops dramatically with cloud computing. Rather than installing and networking a new hardware server, the new server can be dialed up and imaged in through a self‐serve control console. Or better yet, with a private cloud, your service provider can dial up a new server with a single call or support ticket. This mechanism also allows you to foster innovation by allowing you to try new configuration quickly and easily without waiting and paying for each new configuration.
4. Scale as Needed – As your applications grow, you can add storage, RAM and CPU capacity as needed. This means you can buy “just enough” and scale as the application demands grow. In the end, the consumer is only paying for what they use and the level of service they request; similar to phone service.
5. Lower Maintenance Costs – Because cloud computing uses less physical resources, there is less hardware to power and maintain. With an outsourced cloud, you don’t need to keep server, storage, network, and virtualization experts on staff full time.
6. Resiliency and Redundancy – You can get automatic failover between hardware platforms and disaster recovery services to bring up your server set in a separate data center should your primary data center experience an outage.

# •	What skills are you going to learn by the end of this year, why and how?
-	Since I joined this class I am very much interested in learning basic of cloud computing and I am amazed by the advantages of cloud computing it is providing to the technology. I am focused to learn at least one AWS/AZURE/GOOGLE provider’s tools and technology offering and want to clear some certifications to add value in my knowledge.

# •	What are the problems solved technically by cloud computing vs traditional infrastructure?

What I think about cloud computing as a major advantage for disaster recovery. With its multiple region and zone implementation it helps organization to deal with any kind of disasters (Natural, man-made). It makes 100% sure that the production environment is always up and running no matter what. 
Organization doesn’t need to worry about any maintenance as the cloud providers are solely responsible for its maintenance and security.

# •	Post a screenshot of a lab where you had difficulty with a concept or learned something. 

I have completed GCP Essentials Qwiklabs successfully. I had some problems while completing section 2. Even after completing it still it was not marking it completed. So had to do another part of it. Not sure if anyone else faced this issue. But overall it was good learning.
